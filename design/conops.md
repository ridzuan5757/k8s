# System Overview

Purpose of the proposed system or subsystem to which this document applies.
- General nature of the system
- Identify the:
    - Project sponsors
    - User agencies
    - Development organizations
    - Support agencies
    - Certifiers or certifying bodies
    - Operating centres or sites that will run the system
    - Document relevant to the present or proposed system

Graphical overview of the system is strongly recommended:
- Context diagram
- Top-level object diagram
- Type of diagram that depicts the system and its environment

Cited document:
- Project authorization
- Relevant technical document 
- Significant correspondence
- Documents concerning related projects
- Risk analysis reports
- Feasibility studies

# Referenced Documents

- List of document number, title, revision, and date of all referenced in this
  document.
- Identify source for all documents not available through normal channel. 

# Current System

System or situation (either automated or manual) as it currently exists:
- Watchtower
- CloudBOS DataDog
- Sentry
- Uptrace (staging)

If there is no current system on which to base changes:
- Describe situation that motivates development of the proposed system

Provide:
- Introduction to problem domain
- Enable readers to better understand the reasons for the desired changes and
  improvement.

# Background, Objectives and Scope

- Overview of the current system or situation (include if applicable):
    - Background
    - Mission
    - Objectives
    - Scope

When providing the background for the current system:
- Provides a brief summary of the motivation for the current system
    - Example:
        - Automation of certain tasks
        - Countering a certain threat situations
- Define the goal of the current system:
    - Strategies
    - Solutions
    - Tactics
    - Methods
    - Techniques used to accomplish the goal

Define the scope of the proposed system (brief summary only as it will discussed
in greater details in subsequent chapter):
- Mode of operation
- Class of users
- Interfaces to the operational environment 

# Operational Policies and Constraints

Operational policies and costraints that apply to the current system:
- Watchtower
- Sentry
- CloudBOS DataDog
- Hub Staging Uptrace

Operational Policies are predetermined management decisions regarding the
operations of the current system, normally in term of:
- General statements or understanding that guide decision making activities

Policies:
- Limit the decision making freedom but do allow for some discretion

Operational constraints include the following:
- A constraint on the hours of operation of the system, perhaps limited by
  access to secure terminals
- A constraint on the number of personnel available to operate the system
- A constraint on the computer hardware (must operate on computer X)
- A constraint on the operational facilities, such as office space
